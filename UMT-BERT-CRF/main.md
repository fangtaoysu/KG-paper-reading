# paper content

## main content

For Multimodal Named Entity Recongnition, they proposed a multimodal interation module to obtain both image-aware word representations and word-aware visual respresentations base on Transfor.

## drawbacks

1. Others attented word-aware visual representations, but ignore word respresentations under the visual context.
2. Ignoring the bais brought by the visual context.
